<a id="some-linux-basics"></a>

- open terminal ```ctrl + alt + t```
- go to home ```cd ~``` or just ```cd```
- go to last folder ```cd -```
- show current directory ```pwd```
- list content of current folder ```ls -la``` (```man ls```)
- create a new file ```touch my_new_file.ext```
- create a new directory ```mkdir my_new_dir```

  - absolute path ```cd /home/<username>/my_new_dir```
  - relative path ```cd ./my_new_dir```
  - one level up ```cd ..```
- open file in editor ```nano my_new_file.ext``` (or any other editor)
- rename (move) a file ```mv my_new_file.ext my_new_file.new_ext```
- remove file ```rm my_new_file.new_ext```
- remove directory ```rm -rf my_new_dir``` (:warning: very dangerous, always double check)
- put some text to a file ```echo "some strange text" >> my_textfile.txt```
- find text in file ```grep -rnw '.' -e 'strange'```
- :point_up: "double-tab" completes your input and gives you your possibilities
- :arrow_up: goes through the command history

---

## Task: Linux Basics

1. Go to your home folder.
2. Create a new file in a new folder.
3. "echo" some text to the file
4. open the file with an editor and add more lines
5. find a certain string in the file with *grep*
6. create a second empty file
7. delete the second file
8. delete the created folder

(in between, always check the current status with *ls*)

# The Language **C**

<a id="the-language-c"></a>

> **C** [...] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. [...]. **C** is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)))

![width:300px](images/c_as_car_jeep.jpg "c as car")
[If programming languages were vehicles](http://s3.crashworks.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/if-programming-languages-were-vehicles/)

---

# The *basics* Example

<a id="the-basics-example"></a>

Create a new file **basics.c** with the following content

```C
int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```

compile it

```sh
gcc basics.c # using the gnu compiler
clang basics.c # using the clang compiler
```

the result is a **binary** called **a.out**.
You can run the program with ```./a.out```

---

If you want to give the binary a better name use the "**-o**" option

```sh
gcc basics.c -o basics 
```

You can check all possible options with

```sh
man gcc # or 'man clang'
```

Finally, you can run the binary with

```sh
./basics
```

:point_up: you can check the *return* value with: ```./basics; echo $?```

# Git

<a id="git"></a>

![width:150px](images/git.png "git")

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ([Git](https://git-scm.com/))

---

## What is Version Control

> In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control))

---

### Version Control Example Graph

---

## Working on a Local Repository

```sh
mkdir test_repo && cd test_repo
git init # initialize the repository
git status # check status of repository
echo "my first line" > first_file.txt # write something to a new file 
# -> check status
git add first_file.txt # add the file to version control 
# -> check status
git commit -m"initial commit (short msg)" -m"description (long msg)"
# commit the change to the repo 
# -> check status
gitk # opens the git native commit graph
git gui # opens the git native user interface
git log # check your changes on the command line
git log --graph # show the commit graph on command line
```

---

### Task: Branching in Git

1. create a branch with ```git branch my_new_feature```
2. check the available branches with ```git branch```
3. switch to you new branch with ```git checkout my_new_feature```
4. add a new file and edit the one you already have
5. commit your changes
6. switch back to your *main/master* branch
7. merge your changes to your *main/master* with ```git merge my_new_feature```
8. delete your feature branch with ```git branch -D my_new_feature```
9. check your commit graph

:point_up: always remember to check your work with ```git status```

## Working on a Remote Repository

---

<style scoped>
  h3   {font-size: 50px}
  {font-size: 25px}
</style>

### Prerequisites

1. On GitHub create a new repository from the [learn2code template](https://github.com/BenniWi/learn2code_template)
2. Add an SSH key for your machine

   - ![width:1000px](images/ssh-keygen.png "ssh-keygen")
   - Print your public key to console: ```cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub```
   - On GitHub: *profile* &rarr; *settings* &rarr; *SSH and GPG keys* &rarr; *New SSH key*
     - paste and *add* your public key with a descriptive name

---

### Playing around

Go to the new repository you created in the last step and get the URL: *CODE* :arrow_right: *local* :arrow_right: *SSH*

```sh
git clone <InsertYourRepoURL> # get the repo
cd <YourRepoName> # go into the repo folder
echo "some text" > <your file name> #write text to file
# add and commit your changes
git push # bring local changes to the remote repo
```

---

## Some Basics for Git

- do not add binary (large) files
- always write a descriptive message (short + long)
- use [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to keep your workspace clear
- get familiar with the command line
- learn the [best practices](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/7-git-best-practices-to-start-using-in-your-next-commit)

---

# Common Environment

<a id="common-environment"></a>

---

## Why Should I Use It?

![width:300px](images/works_on_my_machine.jpg "works on my machine")

- Maybe you don't have a linux PC
- We all have the same system (compiler etc.)
  - If it works on your machine, it works on my machine
- Necessary tools and configs are already installed

# Basics in **C** #1

<a id="basics-in-c-1"></a>

---

## Using the **C** Standard Library

> The **C** standard library or *libc* is the standard library for the [**C** programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), as specified in the [ISO C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_C) standard. [...]. <br>
> The **C** standard library provides macros, type definitions and functions [...].
> ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library))

---

## Print Something to the Console

```C
#include <stdio.h>  //specify where to look for the functions you need
int main()
{
  /* print something to the command line
  make sure to end with a new line "\n"
  you can find more "control-characters" 
  on e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character
  BTW: this is a multi-line comment */
  printf("Hello World!\n");

  return 0;
}
```

[printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf)

---

## Macros

```C
#include <stdio.h>  //specify where to look for the functions you need

//define a macro, from now on we can use "new_line" instead of "\n"
#define new_line "\n" 

int main()
{
  // append the macro to the string
  printf("Hello World!"new_line);

  return 0;
}

```

[define](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/preprocessor/replace)

---

## Variables & Data Types

As a programmer you want to work with variables to remember a certain value.
In **C**, there are three kinds of basic data types for variables

- **int** - integer (whole number) values
- **float** - floating point values
- **char** - single character values (such as âmâ or âZâ)

---

### Working with Variables

Defining and using a variable in the code is quite easy:

```C
int main()
{
  int x; // defines an integer variable named x
  float y = 1.0; // defines a variable and assigns a value

  x = 5; // initialize x before first usage
  x = x+x; // re-assign a value to x
  return 0;
}
```

---

### Printing Variables to the Console

Using [printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf), the output depends on the datatype!

- **int** (integer values) uses **%d**
- **float** (floating point values) uses **%f**
- **char** (single character values) uses **%c**
- **character strings** (arrays of characters, discussed later) use **%s**

```C
printf("my int %d; my float %.2f; my char %c\n", x, y, c)
```

---

## Operators

- ```+``` â addition
- ```â``` â subtraction
- ```/``` â division
- ```â``` â multiplication
- ```%``` â modulo

Operator precedence is comparable to mathematics.

There are [many more](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/expressions), you should go through them at least once!

---

Some operators make life easier!

```C
x = x + 1; <-> ++x; 
x = x + y; <-> x+=y;
```

:warning: **NEVER** rely on operator precedence

```C
int a = 1;
int b = a++; // stores 1+a (which is 2) to a
             // returns the value of a (which is 1)
             // After this line, b == 1 and a == 2
a = 1;
int c = ++a; // stores 1+a (which is 2) to a
             // returns 1+a (which is 2)
             // after this line, c == 2 and a == 2
```

(example from [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_incdec))

---

## Structures & Arrays

---

### Structures

```C
int main()
{
  // declare a structure and name it "my_struct"
  struct my_struct 
  {
    int a,b,c;
    float d,e,f;
  }ms1; // instantly instantiate a structure of this type with name ms1
  // instantiate a structure without initialization -> be careful
  struct my_struct ms2;
  // instantiate a structure with initialization
  struct my_struct ms3 = {.a=5, .b=6, .c=7, .d=0.1, .e=0.2, .f=0.3};
  // access elements of a structure 
  int k = ms3.a + ms3.b + ms3.c;
  return 0;
}
```

---

```C
// globally defined structure (outside of main)
// works equivalent to define a structure inside of main
struct outer_struct 
{
  int a,b,c;
  float d,e,f;
};

// declare a new type of structure
// typedef can be used to define any kind of new type
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/typedef
typedef struct 
{
  int a,b,c;
  float d,e,f;
} outer_td_struct;

int main()
{
  //locally instantiated structure "or" with direct initialization 
  struct outer_struct or = {.a=5, .b=6, .c=7, .d=0.1, .e=0.2, .f=0.3};

  //using the new type of structure to instantiate structure "otd"
  outer_td_struct otd = {.a=5, .b=6, .c=7, .d=0.1, .e=0.2, .f=0.3};

  return 0;
}
```

---

### Arrays

```C
int main()
{
  int a[5]; // declare an array without initialization -> be careful
  int b[5] = {0}; // initialize all values with zeros
  int c[5] = {22, 33, 44, 55, 66}; // initialize all values explicitly
  int d[] = {22, 33, 44, 55, 66};  // you don't need to specify the size
  int e[5];
  e[0] = 10; // !!! array indices always start at 0 ....
  e[1] = 3;
  e[2] = 13;
  e[3] = 22;
  e[4] = 77; // ... and end with n-1

  return 0;
}
```

---

## Pointers

---

### Using Pointers

```C
int i, j;
int *p;  // define pointer to integer. p holds a random unknown address now
// trying to use *p most probably creates a seg fault
int *pi = NULL;  // now pointer is initialized. Still a segfault, but we can check it
printf("uninitialized: p points to: %p\n", p);  // %p is "pointer address"
p = &i;                                         // assign the address of i to p
printf("initialized p, uninitialized i: value *p=%d, p points to %p\n", *p, p);
*p = 5;  // assign value to the memory of the pointer
printf("initialized p, initialized i: value *p=%d, p points to %p\n", *p, p);
j = i;  // copy the value from i to j
printf("i=%d, j=%d, value *p=%d, p points to %p\n", i, j, *p, p);

struct my_struct
{
    int a;
    float b;
} my1 = {.a = 2, .b = 3.3f};
struct my_struct *p_my2 = &my1;
// accessing elements of pointer-to-struct is done by "->" instead of "."
printf("Struct value a=%i from instance; struct value b=%.1f from pointer!\n", my1.a, p_my2->b);
```

---

### Size of Pointers

```C
// sizeof returns the size of a datatype in bytes
// lets test the size of some basic datatypes
printf("size of char: %lu\n", sizeof(char));
printf("size of int: %lu\n", sizeof(int));
printf("size of float: %lu\n", sizeof(float));
printf("size of double: %lu\n", sizeof(double));
printf("size of long: %lu\n", sizeof(long));

printf("size of char*: %lu\n", sizeof(char*));
printf("size of int*: %lu\n", sizeof(int*));
printf("size of float*: %lu\n", sizeof(float*));
printf("size of double*: %lu\n", sizeof(double*));
printf("size of long*: %lu\n", sizeof(long*));
```

---

# What is **Compiling**?

<a id="what-is-compiling"></a>

---

## Preprocessor - Compiler - Linker

### Preprocessor

```sh
gcc -E basics_in_c_macro.c
# or
clang -E basics_in_c_macro.c
```

Can you figure out what the preprocessor does?

---

### Compiler

```sh
clang -c basics_in_c_macro.c
nano basics_in_c_macro.o # naive approach to show content of object file
objdump -D basics_in_c_macro.o # use linux tools to inspect the file
```

#### Task

Figure out the options in the following command. What are they doing?

```sh
clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -O0 basics_in_c_macro.c
```

---

#### Example *Implicit Conversion*

Additional compiler flags can help you in finding bugs very early.
A typical example is the *implicit conversion*

```C
int b = 2;
float a = 5.0F;
a = 5.0 / b;
printf("float a = %.3f\n", a);  // seems to work correctly -> a = 2.500
a = 5 / b;
printf("float a = %.3f\n", a);  // definitely wrong output -> a = 2.000
```

You could find this problem with the *gcc flag* ```-Wconversion```

![width:1000px](images/implicit_conversion.png "implicit-conversion")

---

### Linker

We did not call the linker!
Well, let's check if we linked something

On Linux

```sh
ldd a.out
```

On Mac

```sh
otool -L a.out
```

---

## Compiler vs. Interpreter

[compiler vs interpreter](https://www.ionos.de/digitalguide/websites/web-entwicklung/compiler-vs-interpreter/)

### C

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
clang basics_in_c.c && ./a.out
```

---

### Python

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```

```sh
python3 basics_in_c_python.py
```

What are the advantages of the interpreter language?
What are the downsides?

---

# CMake

<a id="cmake"></a>

![width:150px](images/cmake.png "cmake")
> CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files [...]. ([CMake](https://cmake.org/))

Book recommendation: [Professional CMake](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/)

---

## CMake Toolchain Workflow

![width:800px](images/cmake_make_gcc.png "cmake")

---

## Write a CMake Config

CMake config is always a file named CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
# define the minimum cmake version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)

# define the project name
project(cmake_example VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES C)

# define the c standard version
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

# add some compile options
add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O0)

# add an executable and assign files to it
add_executable(cmake_example_exec cmake.c)
```

---

## Running CMake

```sh
cd <folder-with-CMakeLists.txt>
cmake . # run cmake
make # build your project
./cmake_example # run your binary
```

Result: your workspace gets polluted :unamused:

---

Define sources and build folder

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
```

<font size="+1">
&#9757; Please delete all generated files from your workspace first
</font>
<br>
Still, there are some things undefined.
Add:

```sh
-G "Unix Makefiles" 
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang 
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ 
```

Figure out what these options are doing with:

```sh
cmake --help
```

<font size="+1">
(Learn more about <a href="[url](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)">generators</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)">ninja</a>)
</font>

---

Still, calling **CMake** seems to be tedious :sweat:
Let's create a small script for that.
Create a file called *run_cmake.sh*

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cmake -S . -B build #add all your options
```

---

## CMake Misc

1. You probably recognized, that you have to go to the *build* folder before calling ```make``` :wink:
2. Can you run your script *run_cmake.sh*? Probably not! Try ```chmod +x run_cmake.sh```! - What does this?

---

# Debugging

<a id="debugging"></a>

![width:250px](images/debugging_monkeyuser.png "debugging")
>In computer programming and software development, **debugging** is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging))

---

## Debugging-Prerequisites

- you have to tell the compiler to create *debug symbols*
  - extend CMake build with:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
  ```

- either use gdb or [lldb](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html)

---

## Debug with **lldb**

(:warning: unfortunately not working on codespace / gitpod)

```sh
lldb debugging_example_exec # this is the name of your binary defined in CMakeLists.txt
(lldb) breakpoint set --file debugging.c  --line 12 # this is the name of your source file
(lldb) process launch
(lldb) help # to get the possible commands
(lldb) v # shows all variables
(lldb) v val1 # shows only variable val1
(lldb) s # step to next line or step into current function
(lldb) c # continue to next breakpoint or end
(lldb) exit # leave lldb
```

---

## Debug With **gdb**

```sh
gdb debugging_example_exec # this is the name of your binary defined in CMakeLists.txt
(gdb) break debugging.c:12 # this is the name of your source file
(gdb) run
(gdb) help # to get the possible commands
(gdb) info locals # shows all variables
(gdb) p val1 # shows only variable val1
(gdb) s # step to next line or step into current function
(gdb) next # continue to next breakpoint or end
(gdb) q # leave gdb
```

---

# Visual Studio Code

<a id="visual-studio-code"></a>

Until now, we did everything on the command line.
It is time to get a bit lazy :smirk:
(You have to have the [CMake Tools Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux) installed)

---

## VS Code - Loading the Project

- right click *CMakeLists.txt* &rarr; *Configure All Projects*
- If you are asked for to select a *kit* &rarr; select one for linux
  ![width:700px](images/vs_code_select_configuration.png "vs code kit")

---

## VS Code - Build, Run & Debug

After configuring the project, you can build, run & debug your project using the extension buttons on the bottom of the window.

![width:1000px](images/vs_code_build_and_run.png "vs code build")

There, you can also change:

- build toolkit
- Debug/Release configuration
- build target
  ...

(Setting breakpoints in a code file is easy, try to figure it out)

---

## VS Code - Git

There are also several Git Extensions.
A very good one is [Git Lense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens).
Even if is absolutely **mandatory** to know the git command line, VS Code gives you some comfort:

- Check the git symbol on the left of VS Code
- Check the additional right click actions for files

## Code Formatting with VS Code

Using a common coding format eases collaboration on code *a lot*.
Common coding format contains rules about: braces, brackets, number of spaces (tab usage), spaces between operators, and many more.

VS Code provides an easy way to format your files automatically.

- install clang-tidy
- install VS Code extension *xaver.clang-format*
- copy the [.clang-format config file](https://github.com/BenniWi/learn-git/blob/main/.clang-format) to your main folder
- open a file and press *Ctrl* + &#8679; + *P* (&#8984; + &#8679; + *P*)
- search for *format document* &rarr; click to execute

# User Input in **C**

<a id="user-input-in-c"></a>

- Reading user input is as easy as printing something.
- Similar to [printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf) we use [scanf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf) to read in values.
- The **type** of data is important, e.g. ```%d``` for integer values

```C
// read in an integer value from the console
scanf("%d", &val1) ;
```

:point_up: The ```&``` sign is very important. We learned that in the chapter  [*pointers*](#pointers)

## Branching & Looping

### if

```C
  int b;
  printf("Enter a value:");
  scanf("%d",&b);
  if(b < 0)
  {
    printf("The value is negative\n");
  }
  else if(b==0)
  {
    printf("The value is zero\n");
  }
  else
  {
    printf("The value is positive\n");
  }
```

Read more  about [comparison operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/expressions)

---

### switch case

```C
int a = 2;
switch (a)
{
    case 1:
        printf("a is one\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("a is two\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("a is three\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("a is something else\n");
        break;
}
```

---

### while

```C
int a = 0, b = 10;
while (a < b)
{
  printf("%d\n", a);
  ++a;
}
```

```C
int a = 0, b = 10;
do
{
  printf("%d\n", a);
  ++a;
}while (a < b);
```

---

### for

> The for loop in C is simply a shorthand way of expressing a while statement ([The Basics of C Programming](https://www.phys.uconn.edu/~rozman/Courses/P2200_13F/downloads/TheBasicsofCProgramming-draft-20131030.pdf))

```C
int a = 0, b = 10;
while (a < b)
{
  printf("%d\n", a);
  ++a;
}
```

```C
int a, b;
for (a = 0, b = 10; a < b; ++a)
{
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

# Functions

<a id="functions"></a>

So far, we wrote spaghetti-code :spaghetti:
We can change this by defining a **function**

```C
return_value my_function_name(<datatype> input_1, <datatype> input_2)
{
  <do something>
  return <a value>;
}
```

Put this **IN FRONT** of your main and you can use the function in the code!

---

## Create a Prototype

The overview is not very good having all the functions in front of the *main*.
You can create a **prototype** only instead:

```C
return_value my_function_name(<datatype> input_1, <datatype> input_2);
```

Now, you can *define* the function **AFTER** the **main**

```C
int main(void) {return 0;}

return_value my_function_name(<datatype> input_1, <datatype> input_2)
{
  <do something>
  return <a value>;
}
```

---

## Create Files for Prototype and Definition

Even with the prototype, the overview is not perfect. Putting code in separate files would help!

1. Create a header file for the prototype (e.g. *include/functions.h*). Always use [include guards](#include-guards)
2. Create a source file for the definition (e.g. *src/functions.c*)
3. Include the header in your main file
4. Tell the compiler where to find everything (*CMakeLists.txt* â¡ï¸ [target_include_directories](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html))

---

## Include Guards

<a id="include-guards"></a>

```C
/*
    always put an "include guard" on top.
    good practice is to use the uppercase file name + a random string.
    In big projects you never know if somebody else named the file and the
    include guard the same.
    For random Strings use e.g. https://www.random.org/strings/
*/
#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H_18RqkXbbAj
#define FUNCTIONS_H_18RqkXbbAj

// prototypes and definitions go here!

#endif /* FUNCTIONS_H_18RqkXbbAj */
```

[random string](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=8&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) online
or

---

## Future Project Structure

From now on, we will stick to the following folder structure

- \<project-name\>
  - `include` ( â¡ï¸ contains all header files)
  - `src`     ( â¡ï¸ contains all source files)
  - `test`    ( â¡ï¸ contains test files)
  - `doc`     ( â¡ï¸ contains relevant files for documentation)
  - `CMakeLists.txt`
  - `readme.md`
  - ...

# Libraries

<a id="libraries"></a>

So, we learned how to extract code into extra files :sparkler:.
It could be even better.
How about creating an own library - like the **C** standard library we use all the time?

---

## Types of Libraries

![width:500px](images/static_vs_dynamic_lib_2.png "static_vs_dynamic") ![width:600px](images/static_vs_dynamic_lib.png "static_vs_dynamic")

## How to Create a Library

On Linux and using *CMake*, creating a library is dead simple :sparkles:

```cmake
# add a library
add_library(<library_name> <STATIC | SHARED> <source_files>)
# add the includes to the library
target_include_directories(<library_name> PUBLIC include)
```

Now, you can use the new library for your executable

```cmake
# add an executable and assign files to it
add_executable(<exec_name> src/main.c)
# add the include directories
target_include_directories(<exec_name> PUBLIC include)
# link your libraries
target_link_libraries(<exec_name> PRIVATE <library_name>)
```

<font size="+1">To be honest: using (3rd party) libraries can be extremely tedious &#128546;</font>

---

### Task: Create Two Libraries and Consume Them

1. Create a static library which contains a function to add two integers
2. Create a shared library which gives you a nice **Batman** print
3. Create a *main* which consumes (links and uses) both libraries
4. Figure out what the Linux tool **ldd** does
5. Check your compiled *main* with **ldd**, what do you see (and what not)?

# Const Correctness

<a id="const-correctness"></a>

---

## What is *const*

[const type qualifier](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/const)

```C
/* declare a const value variable */
const int value_c = 33; // const value variable
value_c = 0; // assign a new value -> ERROR
```

---

## Different Types of *const* Pointers

```C
/* declare a normal pointer */
int* ptr = &value_a;
ptr = &value_b; // assign a new memory address
*ptr = 33; // assign a new value

/* declare a const value pointer */
int const * const_s_ptr = &value_a; // const value pointer
const_s_ptr = &value_b; // assign a new memory address
*const_s_ptr = 44; // assign a new value -> ERROR

/* declare a const address pointer */
int * const s_const_ptr = &value_a; // const address pointer
s_const_ptr = &value_b; // assign a new memory address -> ERROR
*s_const_ptr = 55; // assign a new value

/* declare a const value and const address pointer*/
int const * const const_s_const_ptr = &value_a; // const value const address pointer
const_s_const_ptr = &value_b; // assign a new memory address -> ERROR
*const_s_const_ptr = 44; // assign a new value -> ERROR
```

---

## *const* Correctness in Functions

```C
int* my_const_correct_function(int * mutable_ptr, int const * const immutable_ptr)
{
  int * inside_ptr; 
  int const * const inside_csc_ptr = immutable_ptr;

  inside_ptr = mutable_ptr; // fine
  ++*inside_ptr;  // fine
  ++*mutable_ptr; // fine
  
  //inside_ptr = immutable_ptr; // BAD, warning: assignment discards âconstâ qualifier 
  //++*immutable_ptr; // ERROR, can not change the pointer value or address

  return inside_ptr; // fine
  //return inside_csc_ptr; // BAD, return discards âconstâ qualifier
}
```

```C
int* return_ptr = my_const_correct_function(ptr, s_const_ptr);
```

# Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment

<a id="continuous-integration-delivery--deployment"></a>

---

## Continuous Integration

> In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration))

---

## Continuous Delivery

> Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery))

---

## Continuous Deployment

> Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently and through automated deployments. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment))

---

## **CI/CD** Tools

![width:400px](images/jenkins.png "github actions") ![width:250px](images/github_actions_logo.png "github actions") ![width:450px](images/bamboo.png "github actions")

---

## Github Actions

[**Github Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) allow you to continuously integrate, deliver and even deploy your software.
For now, we want to use [**Github Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) to *build* and *test* our software continuously.
<br>
:point_up: There is way more we could do, but that's the absolute minimum

---

### Create New Action (Pipeline)

![width:900px](images/github_actions.png "github actions")

---

### Add a Workflow

![width:600px](images/github_actions_new_wf.png "github new workflow")

---

### Add CMake Workflow

![width:800px](images/github_actions_cmake.png "github cmake workflow")

---

### Specify Your Build Commands

You will get a first proposal for your workflow file.
E.g. *.github/workflows/cmake.yml*
In this file you need to make sure, that

1. gtest is installed (if you need it)
2. all your build steps are executed
3. all your paths are correct
