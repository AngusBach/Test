## Grades Average

Write a program in **C** to calculate the average (rational number) of multiple grades (natural numbers). Output the result on the command line with one digit after the decimal point. Use an *array* for the grades. The size of the array should be fixed (e.g. 5 elements).

Example:

```sh
Values: 1, 2, 4, 1, 3
Average: 2.2  
```

## Calculate Percentages

Write a program in **C** to calculate a given percentage of value, where the percentage and the value should be natural numbers. The result of the calculation is a rational number.

```sh
Value: 90
Percentage: 11
11% of 90 equals 9.9!
```
